# g1

`g1` is a micro-framework collection that makes it easy to write front-end data
applications. It's a humble alternative to [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/),
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

To use it, include:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/npm/jquery,npm/lodash,npm/g1"></script>
```

[Read the documentation](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/g1/) for usage.
